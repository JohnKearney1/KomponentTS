## Code Style and Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability across the project:
- **Language:** Utilize TypeScript `ts` or `tsx` where appropriate. Avoid hacky JavaScript solutions, and keep clear type definitions.
- **Naming:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
- **Component Structure:** Follow the established structure for React components.
- **Tests:** Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes if you are unable.
- **Icons:** This project uses Radix Icons for its iconography. For now, radix icons are installed as a package.
- **Styling:** Use CSS for styling components. Avoid inline styles and use utility classes where possible. Use global styles and create variables for colors, spacing, etc. in the `index.css` file. This project uses a ThemeProvider to provide global styles and theme variables to components.
- **Storybook Support**: If you are adding a new component, please add a story to the Storybook. This will help us visualize the component and its variations.
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the changes you are making.


If youâ€™re unsure about any style or guideline, submit a PR and weâ€™ll help you out!
