# Komponent (React Library)

![`version: a-1.0.0`](./src/assets/img/screenshot.png)

Komponent is my lightweight, flexible component library for React. It is designed to be a very blank, highly customizable component library that can be used to build any kind of UI with a high degree of advanced styling options. It is built with TypeScript and some basic pre-styled-components.

This library is still in development (very much a WIP). As such, there is no build. To develop, see usage instructions below.

## Usage

#### Setup

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

#### Development Environment
- Run `npm run storybook` to open the Storybook interface.
- Develop components in the `src/components` directory.
- Add stories for the components in the `src/stories` directory.

#### Build the Library
- Run `npm run build` to build the library.
- The library will be built in the `dist` directory.


## Components

For a full list of component props and usage, see the Storybook interface, or visit the [Komponent Wiki](https://github.com/JohnKearney1/komponent/wiki).
