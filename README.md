## About 🌟

KomponentTS is a lightweight and flexible React component library designed for a "plug and play" experience. It offers hyperconsistent, pre-styled components optimized for both light and dark modes, with a strong emphasis on accessibility and usability. While the library is fully customizable, its default styles are intended to help you quickly build applications without the overhead of extensive styling.

> **Note:** This library is still under development (WIP) and does not yet include a full build process. For development instructions, please see the Usage section below.

## Usage ⚙️

#### Setup

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

#### Development
- Run `npm run storybook` to open the Storybook interface.
- Develop components in the `src/components` directory.
- Add stories for the components in the `src/stories` directory.

#### Testing
- Run `npm run test` to run tests.
- Run `npm run test:watch` to run tests in watch mode.

#### Build the Library
- Run `npm run build` to build the library.
- The library will be built in the `dist` directory.


## Components 📦

For detailed documentation on component properties and usage examples, please visit the [Komponent Wiki](https://github.com/JohnKearney1/komponent/wiki) or explore the Storybook interface.

> **Note:** The Storybook interface is available at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) when running `npm run storybook`. However, the autodocs plugin occasionally fails to provide accurate documentation for some abstract components (e.g. `ThemeProvider`), so please refer to the Wiki for the most accurate information.

Happy coding! 😄
